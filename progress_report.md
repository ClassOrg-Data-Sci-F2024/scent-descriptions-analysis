# Progress report 1 
## October 7, 2024
I created the "scent descriptions analysis" repo, and added the relevant files. I found some papers that might be helpful in addition to the Winter (2016) I mentioned in the project idea, and the Jurafsky that was suggested, I also found HÃ¶rberg et al (2022) and Poulton (2020). 

I read up a bit on XML which should give me some kind of conceptual grounding for when I actually my data. I also am trying to get a better understanding of emtional valence and valence norms, but I admit, the Winter (2016) was challenging for me.
